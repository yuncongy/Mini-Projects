## 1. ðŸŽ® Minesweeper Program (Java)

This project is a classic Minesweeper game developed using Java Swing. It adheres to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, promoting a clear separation of concerns between the game's data, user interface, and logic.

Players can enjoy the familiar gameplay of uncovering squares, strategically marking potential mine locations, and aiming to clear the board without detonating any hidden explosives. A notable technical feature is its recursive algorithm, which efficiently uncovers large, empty regions of the minefield automatically when a square with no adjacent mines is clicked. This significantly enhances the user experience by revealing large safe areas with a single click.


## 2. ðŸ“ˆ Mini Stock Trading System (C, Socket Programming)
This project implements a client-server stock trading system using both TCP and UDP protocols. It's designed to handle user authentication, portfolio management, stock quoting, buying, and selling functionalities through a distributed architecture involving a main server and multiple backend servers.
